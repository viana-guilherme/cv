## Summary

I am a motivated doctoral candidate with over eight years of hands-on experience in research. I expect to defend my thesis by February 2025 and look forward to further developing my skills and gaining experience as a bioinformatician and data scientist after graduation.

### Key skills & techniques

I have extensive wet lab experience in standard Molecular Biology and Microbiology techniques (media preparation, nucleic acid purification, polymerase chain reaction, restriction cloning, Gibson assembly, microplate assays, flow cytometry, and shake-flask culturing of bacteria) and sequencing (especially Nanopore sequencing).

I am also proficient in several frameworks and computational pipelines for the analysis of different types of biological data (including genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic datasets) using R (Tidyverse packages, Bioconductor packages, DESeq2, vegan, dada2 and flowCore), Python (Biopython, numpy, pandas and matplotlib) git and bash (general scripting). I have used several CLI Bioinformatics tools such as the SRA Toolkit, Trimmomatic, Kallisto, RSEM, Minimap2 and Guppy).

## Experience


### Research Associate

<subtle>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \| Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) (2023 - 2024)</subtle>

#### Improving biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass in *Pseudomonas putida*

I collaborated with Dr. Aindrila Mukhopadhyay during an internship at JBEI (Emeryville, CA, US) to develop tolerized _P. putida_ strains with **enhanced growth and biofuel production metrics** in mock hydrolysate culture media. In the course of this project I have extensively worked with the generation, analysis and reporting of proteomics and genomics data, as well as the screening and phenotypical characterization of microbial isolates. Results deriving from this work are being compiled in a manuscript to be submitted for publication later this year.

### Graduate Student

<subtle>University of São Paulo (2018 - ongoing)</subtle>

#### Searching for new molecular tools to enhance *Pseudomonas putida* robustness to abiotic stresses

In my PhD project, we intend to develop and characterize new tools for better manipulating *P. putida* as a host for bioproduction. Our approach to this project comprises several objectives:

-   I have **designed and validated the pVANT family of vectors**, based on the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA). pVANT reporter vectors have been cloned in different species of environmental bacteria, exhibiting improved fluorescence when compared to their SEVA counterparts while retaining modularity, small size and broad host range applicability. This work has been published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2023.

-   I compiled a transcriptomic database from publicly available RNA-seq data, identifying **novel stress-responsive promoters and tolerance-promoting proteins** currently under further characterization in our group.

#### Expanding acid resistance in bacteria using synthetic circuits

While obtaining my Masters degree, I led a project in which we designed synthetic operons, aiming to build optimized gene clusters that conferred *Escherichia coli* the ability to **thrive in low pH**. This work was published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2020.

### Other interests

I am passionate about coding and tools that simplify biological data analysis and improve reproducibility. I am currently developing my two first R packages:  [mipreadr](https://github.com/viana-guilherme/mipreadr), a small package for the analysis of microbial growth data from microplate readers, and [fitnessbrowseR](https://github.com/viana-guilherme/fitnessbrowseR), a package for programmatic retrieval of data from the [Fitness Browser](https://fit.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/myFrontPage.cgi) database
