## Summary

I am a motivated doctoral candidate with more than eight years of hands-on experience in Molecular Biology, Microbiology, and Bioinformatics. I expect to defend my thesis in the spring of 2025 and am eager to continue developing my skills and gaining experience as a bioinformatician and data scientist after graduation.

## Experience

### Research Associate

<subtle>Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \| Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI) (2023 - 2024)</subtle>

#### <span class="highlight">Project: Improving biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass in *Pseudomonas putida*</span>

I collaborated with Dr. Aindrila Mukhopadhyay at JBEI (Emeryville, CA, US) to develop tolerized _P. putida_ strains with enhanced growth and biofuel production metrics in mock hydrolysate culture media. Results deriving from this work are being compiled in a manuscript to be submitted for publication later this year.

### Graduate Student

<subtle>University of São Paulo (2018 - ongoing)</subtle>

#### <span class="highlight">Project: Searching for new molecular tools to enhance *Pseudomonas putida* robustness to abiotic stresses </span>

In my PhD project, we intend to develop and characterize new tools for better manipulating *P. putida* as a host for bioproduction. During this project:

-   I have designed and validated the pVANT family of vectors, based on the Standard European Vector Architecture (SEVA). This work has been published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2023.

-   I compiled a transcriptomic database from publicly available RNA-seq data of _P. putida_, identifying novel stress-responsive promoters and tolerance-promoting proteins currently under further characterization in our group.

#### <span class="highlight">Project: Expanding acid resistance in bacteria using synthetic circuits</span>

During my Master's degree, I led a project in which we designed synthetic operons, aiming to build optimized gene clusters that conferred *Escherichia coli* the ability to thrive in under extremely acidic conditions. This work was published in ACS Synthetic Biology in 2020.

### Other interests

I am passionate about data visualization and tools that simplify biological data analysis and improve reproducibility. I am currently developing my first two R packages: [mipreadr](https://github.com/viana-guilherme/mipreadr), a package for the analysis of microbial growth data from microplate readers, and [fitnessbrowseR](https://github.com/viana-guilherme/fitnessbrowseR), a package for programmatic retrieval of data from the [Fitness Browser](https://fit.genomics.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/myFrontPage.cgi) database. I also recently began teaching myself JavaScript for the development of web apps using React and D3.
